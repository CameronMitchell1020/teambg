    <h1>Team BG - Terms of Service</h1>

    <p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>By using my Discord bot, Team BG, you agree to abide by these Terms of Service. These terms are designed to ensure the responsible use of my Bot in preventing underage users from accessing NSFW content on Discord.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Age Restriction</strong></p>
    <p>2.1. The bot is designed to prevent underage users from accessing NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content on Discord servers.</p>
    <p>2.2. The bot will actively enforce age restrictions to ensure that only users who meet the age requirements can access NSFW channels. I am always finding new ways to</p>

    <p><strong>3. Age Verification</strong></p>
    <p>3.1. When you invite the bot, Team BG, to your Discord server, it will not automatically apply age verification mechanisms. User input is required for setup, and instructions can be accessed with /setup.</p>
    <p>3.2. Users should comply with the age verification process to gain access to NSFW channels.</p>
    <p>3.3. Failure to complete the age verification process accurately may result in restricted access to NSFW content. Any server with NSFW content that is not taking proper protections violates these terms as well as Discord's Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Compliance with Discord Guidelines</strong></p>
    <p>4.1. I expect all users to comply with Discord's community guidelines and any specific server rules regarding NSFW content.</p>
    <p>4.2. Any violations of these rules may result in appropriate actions taken by server administrators.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Reporting Violations</strong></p>
    <p>5.1. If you encounter any users who are attempting to access NSFW content without meeting the age requirements or violating server rules, please report them to the server administrators.</p>
    <p>5.2. Your reports will assist in maintaining a safe and age-appropriate environment on Discord servers.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>6.1. I respect your privacy. Personal information collected during the age verification process will be handled in accordance with my Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Code Updates</strong></p>
    <p>7.1. I reserve the right to update my code without prior notification. These updates may include improvements, bug fixes, or additional features.</p>
    <p>7.2. To ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of the bot, I recommend regularly checking for new revisions using the /version command.</p>

    <p><strong>8. Termination</strong></p>
    <p>8.1. I reserve the right to revoke my access to your server or suspend my services if the bot is misused, or if you violate these Terms of Service.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Contact</strong></p>
    <p>9.1. If you have any questions or concerns about these Terms of Service or how to use the bot effectively, please contact me, Cameron Mitchell, via Support Server.</p>

    <p><strong>10. Agreements</strong></p>
    <p>10.1. You do hereby acknowledge that I am based and chad pilled, as well as an excellent programmer.</p>
    <p>10.2. You agree that realtree camo is the best brand on the market and I should get a job there as a programmer.</p>
    <p>10.3. You agree that it is a crime that I don't have a good job yet.</p>
    <p>10.4. You agree that Brantley Gilbert is insanely good looking and me and him would get married if he was gay.</p>

    <p>By using the bot, Team BG, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms of Service. Failure to comply with these terms may result in restricted access to NSFW content prevention features provided by me.</p>
