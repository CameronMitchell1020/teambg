  <h1>Team BG - Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    I store publicly available IDs, such as Role IDs, User IDs, and Server IDs provided to the bot for the purpose of providing the service of the bot to you. Nothing else about you, your messages, or your account is stored. I also store webhooks that you create on your server. If at any time you would like to remove this data, simply remove the bot from your server, and it will automatically delete any personalized information associated with that server, including webhooks.
  </p>

  <p>
    With OAuth2 interactions, I store your User ID, and use the code you grant to update your linked roles for the bot. After that is done the codes are disposed of.
  </p>

</body>Regarding the in development ID age verification, I store the following information:

  </html> Your public discord user ID and your date of birth from your photo ID. This can be deleted at will by going to "https://oauth2.teambg.camp/delete". Keep in mind this action is irreversable and if you wish to verify using my bot again you will need to pay again.

<p>
    All information is encrypted using bitlocker device encryption, and sensitive information is encrypted further.
</p>

<p><strong>Regarding sale of user data</strong></p>
<p>I will not, under any circumstances, sell user data of any kind to any third party. I will also not distribute the data freely with anyone under any circumstances.</p>
