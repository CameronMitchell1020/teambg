  <h1>Team BG - Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    I store publicly available information, such as Role IDs, User IDs, and Server IDs provided to the bot for the purpose of providing the service of the bot to you. Nothing else about you, your messages, or your account is stored. I also store webhooks that you create on your server. If at any time you would like to remove this data, simply remove the bot from your server, and it will automatically delete any personalized information associated with that server, including webhooks.
